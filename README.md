# Devanagari Script Analyzer

## Overview

The Devanagari Script Analyzer is a tool designed to assist users in understanding and converting Devanagari script characters and words into their Latin script equivalents. This project is part of the LING 508: Computational Techniques for Linguistics course for Summer 2024, under the instruction of Eric Jackson. The analyzer focuses on two main functionalities:
- **Character Identification**: Provides detailed information about a single Devanagari character.
- **Word Transliteration**: Converts Devanagari script words into Latin script.
